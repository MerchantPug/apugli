**General**
- Port to 1.19.4 (Fabric only for now.)
- Added `damage_type` fields to anything with a Damage Source field.
- `apugli:rocket_jump` no longer uses a custom damage type for the explosion.

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed an issue where apugli:rocket_jump explosions' `damage_bientity_condition` field doesn't function properly.
