### Forge
- Reintroduced Forge module for 1.20.1, meant to be used with Origins Forge 1.10.0.x.

### Developer Notes
Depending on Apugli in a Common/Xplat module has become a lot easier as I have now removed the extra dependencies from the Fabric version of Origins (of which Common used to depend on).
